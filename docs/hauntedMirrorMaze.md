# Haunted Mirror Maze Model
## 1. Rules
- Fill each empty box of the puzzle grid with the right monster: a ghost, vampire, or zombie
- The clues along the edges tell you how many monsters you can see from that point looking into the grid, and the diagonal lines are mirrors that reflect a line of sight 90 degrees, as with a laser..
- Vampires (V) are seen only head-on (have no reflection in a mirror).
- Ghosts (G) are only seen as reflections in mirrors (not head-on).
- Zmobies (Z) are always seen.
- Each puzzle also has a handy list of monsters so you know how many of each type are hiding in that mirror maze.
- Some cells contain the same monsters.
- Some cells contain fixed monsters.
